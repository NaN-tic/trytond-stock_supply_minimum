Stock Supply Minimum
####################

The Stock Supply Minimum module adds Minimum Quantity on the Product's
Supplier field.
It allows to define the minimum purchase quantity for the given product and
supplier, so purchases created for this product and supplier (manually or from
purchase requests) will respect this condition.
