Stock Supply Minimum Module
###########################

The Stock Supply Minimum module adds Minimum Quantity on the Product
Supplier form. This allows to define the minimum purchase quantity for the given
product and supplier so purchases created for this product and supplier from
purchase requests will honour this value.
